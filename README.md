# Realtime V4L2 Cropper

A realtime panning and cropping script. Written in python and leveraging OpenCV and V4L2LoopBack.

## Getting Started

Install the prereqs, download this code, install the virtual environment, enter it, and run it.

### Prerequisites

Linux, Python3+, [LibV4L2Loopback](https://github.com/umlaeute/v4l2loopback)

### Usage
If there's any interest in this project, I'll provide more detailed instructions and I'll update the code to make it work more generically across systems.
```
$ ./setup_webcam.sh
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ python webcam-rt.py
```
